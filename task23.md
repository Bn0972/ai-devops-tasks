**Current Implementation Analysis:**

1. **Time Complexity: O(n²)**
   - The algorithm uses nested loops
   - For each element (n), it compares with every other element (n-1)
   - This results in n * (n-1) / 2 comparisons
   - Therefore, the time complexity is O(n²)

2. **Space Complexity: O(n)**
   - The `pairs` array stores the results
   - In the worst case, if all elements form pairs that sum to the target, we could have n/2 pairs
   - Therefore, the space complexity is O(n)

**Optimized Solution:**
Here's an optimized version using a hash map that reduces the time complexity to O(n):



**Optimized Solution Analysis:**

1. **Time Complexity: O(n)**
   - Single pass through the array
   - Hash map operations (insert and lookup) are O(1) on average
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n)

2. **Space Complexity: O(n)**
   - Hash map stores at most n elements
   - Output array could store n/2 pairs in worst case
   - Therefore, the space complexity remains O(n)

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Efficiency**: Reduced time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)
2. **Readability**: More straightforward implementation
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify
4. **Documentation**: Added JSDoc comments for better code documentation

**Trade-offs:**
1. The optimized version uses more memory (hash map) but gains significant performance
2. The original version might be more intuitive to understand but is less efficient
3. The optimized version handles edge cases more gracefully

**Additional Considerations:**
1. If the input array is sorted, we could use a two-pointer approach which would have O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
2. If we need to handle duplicate pairs differently, we might need to modify the implementation
3. For very small arrays (n < 10), the original O(n²) solution might actually be faster due to the overhead of hash map operations

Would you like me to:
1. Implement the two-pointer approach for sorted arrays?
2. Add more test cases?
3. Add error handling for invalid inputs?
4. Implement a version that handles duplicate pairs differently?
