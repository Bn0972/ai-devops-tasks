**Mistakes Found:**
1. Typo in `stesp` (should be `steps`)
2. Incorrect npm command `npm build` (should be `npm run build`)
3. Missing Docker registry in push command
4. No error handling or post-actions
5. No environment variables for configuration
6. No credentials management for Docker
7. No proper Docker tagging strategy
8. Missing proper stage organization
9. No proper cleanup

Here's the corrected version:



**Explanation of Fixes:**

1. **Structure and Organization:**
   - Added proper pipeline structure with environment variables
   - Separated stages logically (Checkout → Install → Build → Test → Deploy)
   - Added proper stage naming and organization

2. **Dependency Management:**
   - Changed `npm install` to `npm ci` for more reliable builds
   - Added separate stage for dependency installation

3. **Build Process:**
   - Fixed `npm build` to `npm run build`
   - Added artifact archiving for build outputs
   - Added proper error handling

4. **Docker Operations:**
   - Added proper Docker registry configuration
   - Implemented proper tagging strategy using build numbers
   - Added conditional latest tag for master branch
   - Added Docker credentials management

5. **Testing:**
   - Added proper test result reporting with JUnit
   - Separated test stage from build stage

6. **Error Handling and Cleanup:**
   - Added post-actions for success and failure
   - Added workspace cleanup
   - Added proper error handling

7. **Security:**
   - Added Docker credentials management
   - Proper registry URL handling

8. **Best Practices:**
   - Added environment variables for configuration
   - Added proper conditional deployment
   - Added artifact archiving
   - Added proper cleanup

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Reliability:**
   - Proper error handling
   - Clean workspace management
   - Reliable dependency installation

2. **Security:**
   - Proper credentials management
   - Secure Docker operations

3. **Maintainability:**
   - Clear stage organization
   - Proper variable usage
   - Clear documentation

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Test result reporting
   - Build artifact archiving
   - Success/failure notifications

Would you like me to:
1. Add more security features?
2. Include deployment to different environments?
3. Add more detailed error handling?
4. Include performance optimization steps?
