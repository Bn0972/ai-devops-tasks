Let me analyze these metrics and provide recommendations for improvement.

**Current Metrics Analysis:**

1. **Response Time Metrics:**
   - Average: 230ms (acceptable for most applications)
   - 95th percentile: 450ms (shows some latency spikes)
   - 99th percentile: 1200ms (significant spikes affecting 1% of requests)
   - This indicates inconsistent performance with occasional severe slowdowns

2. **Error Rate:**
   - 5xx errors: 120 out of 15,000 requests
   - Error rate: 0.8% (120/15,000)
   - This is above the generally acceptable threshold of 0.1%

3. **Resource Utilization:**
   - CPU: 45% average, 80% peak
   - Memory: 2.1GB average, 3.5GB peak (87.5% of available 4GB)
   - Memory usage is concerning as it's close to the limit

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Memory Pressure:**
   - High memory utilization (87.5% peak) is a red flag
   - Risk of out-of-memory errors
   - Possible memory leaks or inefficient memory management

2. **Response Time Inconsistency:**
   - Large gap between average and 99th percentile (230ms vs 1200ms)
   - Indicates potential bottlenecks or resource contention

3. **Error Rate:**
   - 0.8% error rate is higher than ideal
   - Could indicate stability issues

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Memory Optimization:**
   ```
   - Implement memory monitoring and profiling
   - Review and optimize memory-intensive operations
   - Consider increasing memory limit to 6-8GB
   - Implement garbage collection tuning
   ```

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   ```
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries
   - Consider implementing request queuing
   - Add request timeouts
   ```

3. **Error Handling:**
   ```
   - Implement better error logging and monitoring
   - Add circuit breakers for external dependencies
   - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Add request validation
   ```

4. **Infrastructure Improvements:**
   ```
   - Consider horizontal scaling
   - Implement load balancing
   - Add auto-scaling based on metrics
   - Implement rate limiting
   ```

5. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   ```
   - Set up alerts for:
     * Memory usage > 80%
     * Error rate > 0.1%
     * Response time > 500ms
   - Implement detailed logging
   - Add performance tracing
   ```

6. **Code-level Optimizations:**
   ```
   - Review and optimize slow endpoints
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add request batching where possible
   - Optimize data structures and algorithms
   ```

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Investigate the cause of 5xx errors
2. Monitor memory usage patterns
3. Profile slow requests (those > 500ms)
4. Review error logs for patterns

**Long-term Solutions:**
1. Implement caching strategy
2. Consider microservices architecture
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Implement automated scaling

Would you like me to:
1. Provide specific code examples for any of these optimizations?
2. Create a monitoring dashboard configuration?
3. Develop a detailed performance improvement plan?
4. Suggest specific tools for implementation?
