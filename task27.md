**Pipeline Stage Relationships:**

1. **Initial Development Flow:**
```
Checkout → Build → Test
```
- **Checkout to Build:**
  - Direct dependency: Build requires source code
  - If checkout fails, build cannot proceed
  - Build stage depends on successful code retrieval

- **Build to Test:**
  - Direct dependency: Tests require compiled code
  - Build artifacts are needed for testing
  - Test stage cannot run without successful build

2. **Quality Assurance Flow:**
```
Test → Static Analysis → Security Checks
```
- **Test to Static Analysis:**
  - Sequential dependency
  - Static analysis runs after basic functionality is verified
  - Code must pass tests before quality checks

- **Static Analysis to Security Checks:**
  - Sequential dependency
  - Security checks run after code quality is verified
  - Both stages are quality gates

3. **Containerization Flow:**
```
Security Checks → Docker Build → Integration Tests
```
- **Security to Docker Build:**
  - Direct dependency
  - Only secure code gets containerized
  - Docker build uses artifacts from previous stages

- **Docker Build to Integration Tests:**
  - Direct dependency
  - Tests run against containerized application
  - Container must be built successfully

4. **Deployment Flow:**
```
Integration Tests → Staging Deploy → Staging Tests → Production Approval → Production Deploy
```
- **Integration to Staging:**
  - Direct dependency
  - Staging deployment requires passing integration tests
  - First deployment to a non-production environment

- **Staging Deploy to Staging Tests:**
  - Direct dependency
  - Tests run in staging environment
  - Validates deployment and environment configuration

- **Staging Tests to Production Approval:**
  - Conditional dependency
  - Manual approval gate
  - Can trigger rollback to staging

- **Approval to Production:**
  - Conditional dependency
  - Only proceeds with approval
  - Final deployment stage

**Error Handling Relationships:**

1. **Failure Paths:**
```
Any Stage → Failure
```
- Each stage can fail independently
- Failure in any stage stops the pipeline
- No subsequent stages run after failure

2. **Rollback Path:**
```
Production Approval → Staging Deploy
```
- Rejection triggers rollback
- Returns to staging environment
- Allows for fixes and retesting

**Key Dependencies:**

1. **Hard Dependencies:**
- Checkout → Build
- Build → Test
- Docker Build → Integration Tests
- Staging Deploy → Staging Tests

2. **Soft Dependencies:**
- Test → Static Analysis
- Static Analysis → Security Checks
- Staging Tests → Production Approval

3. **Conditional Dependencies:**
- Production Approval → Production Deploy
- Production Approval → Staging Deploy (rollback)

**Best Practices Illustrated:**

1. **Sequential Dependencies:**
- Clear order of operations
- Each stage builds on previous success
- Proper validation at each step

2. **Quality Gates:**
- Multiple validation points
- Security and quality checks
- Manual approval for production

3. **Environment Progression:**
- Development → Staging → Production
- Clear separation of environments
- Proper testing at each level

Would you like me to:
1. Add more detail about specific stage dependencies?
2. Explain the rollback procedures in more detail?
3. Describe the parallel execution possibilities?
4. Explain the environment-specific configurations?
