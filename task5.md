I'll create a simple ASCII art diagram showing the relationship between a client, application server, and database.



I've created a simple ASCII art diagram that shows:

1. **Client Layer**:
   - Represented by a box on the left
   - Shows examples of clients (Browser, Mobile App, Desktop App)

2. **Application Server Layer**:
   - Middle box showing the server
   - Examples of server technologies (Node.js/Java/Python)
   - Examples of frameworks (Express/Spring/Django)

3. **Database Layer**:
   - Right box showing the database
   - Examples of databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL, MongoDB/Redis)

4. **Connections**:
   - HTTP/HTTPS communication between Client and Server
   - Database queries between Server and Database
   - Bidirectional arrows showing request/response flow

The diagram illustrates the basic three-tier architecture commonly used in web applications, with clear separation of concerns between the client, server, and database layers.

I'll modify the diagram to add clearer labels and data flow directions.



I've updated the diagram with the following improvements:

1. **Added Layer Labels**:
   - [Frontend Layer]
   - [Backend Layer]
   - [Data Layer]

2. **Clarified Data Flow**:
   - Added "Request" and "Response" labels for HTTP communication
   - Added "Write" and "Read" labels for database operations

3. **Added Data Flow Legend**:
   - HTTP Request types (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - HTTP Response types (JSON, HTML, etc.)
   - Database Write operations (INSERT, UPDATE)
   - Database Read operations (SELECT, QUERY)

4. **Direction Indicators**:
   - → for outgoing requests/writes
   - ← for incoming responses/reads

The diagram now better illustrates:
- The three main layers of the application
- The direction of data flow between components
- The types of operations occurring at each step
- The specific protocols and operations being used

This makes it easier to understand how data moves through the system and what operations are performed at each layer.
