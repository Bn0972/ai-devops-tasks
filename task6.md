I'll create a Mermaid diagram showing a basic CI/CD pipeline.



I've created a Mermaid diagram that shows a complete CI/CD pipeline with the following components:

1. **Initial Steps**:
   - Developer commits code
   - Code is pushed to Git Repository
   - Pipeline is triggered

2. **Pipeline Stages** (in a subgraph):
   - Build Stage
   - Test Stage
   - Deploy Stage

3. **Outputs**:
   - Build Artifacts stored
   - Test Reports generated
   - Deployment to Production

4. **Visual Styling**:
   - Different colors for different components
   - Clear directional flow
   - Grouped pipeline stages

The diagram shows:
- The flow from development to production
- The main stages of the CI/CD process
- Where artifacts and reports are stored
- The final deployment to production

The diagram is created using Mermaid syntax, which can be rendered in many Markdown viewers and documentation tools. Would you like me to add any additional stages or modify the existing ones?


This diagram provides a high-level overview of a DevOps pipeline, showing how code flows from a developerâ€™s commit through automated building, testing, and deployment, with intermediate storage of build artifacts and test results, culminating in production release.
