Task1:
1.
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and integration between development and operations teams to improve the speed and reliability of software delivery. By breaking down silos between teams and implementing automated processes for building, testing, and deploying software, DevOps enables organizations to respond more quickly to market changes and customer needs while maintaining system stability and security.
2.
The three most popular tools used in DevOps are:

1. **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server that helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.

2. **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, which allows developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

3. **Kubernetes**: An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, making it easier to manage complex container environments.
